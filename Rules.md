# Rules:

### By joining our Community even though there aren’t many trolls or jerks you agree that you’ll be respectful and listen to our rules


### In case you violate a rule you’ll be warned and given a penalty. If you get 4 Penalties your account is going to be suspended. If you get a warning and you think it’s wrong you can appeal it to the *mod team. If you have your account suspended please message one of the moderators on our Subreddit.


### We reserve the right to ban users if the violation is much more serious!
