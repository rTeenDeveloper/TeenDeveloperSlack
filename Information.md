# Information about /r/TeenDeveloper Slack chat.

The Slack Workspace is the offical Channel rTeenDeveloper uses for communication purposes. Every other platform used is not maintained or moderated by TeenDeveloper moderators

*This is the official Platform we use for communicating.*

Who are we: We are a community of teenagers that code,program,develop,make,build stuff using their laptops and computers. We are here 24/7. If you need someone urgently please mention one of the mods.

For making life simple and sticking to the conversation @google is here to help you. Either for your seaches, need to define a word or translate something he’s here. Just ping him and ask him. Oh and he automatically converts from fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit. Celsius is the best.
